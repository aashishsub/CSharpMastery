# Number Guessing Game 

A simple console-based game written in **C# and .NET** where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## What I Learned
- Basic C# syntax (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Input validation using `int.TryParse`
- Random number generation
- Program structure and modular functions

## How to Run
```bash
dotnet run
