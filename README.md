# CSharpMastery

This repository tracks my journey learning C# and .NET, building up from basic exercises to more advanced projects.  
The goal is to gain hands-on experience with C#, .NET development, and backend concepts relevant to Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## Structure

- `Basics/` – simple programs to learn syntax, control flow, and data types.
  - `FirstConsoleApp/` – Hello World program
- `Intermediate/` – exercises on OOP, LINQ, collections, and file I/O.
- `Projects/` – small real-world projects integrating C# with .NET and SQL.

## Progress

- FirstConsoleApp: “Hello World” program to test environment setup.
- [Next Steps] Implement exercises on variables, loops, and conditionals.

## Usage

Each folder contains self-contained programs. To run any program:
```bash
cd <folder>
dotnet run
